## Project Dependencies Analysis

### Luxon Usage

The project relies heavily on the `luxon` library (maintained by moment/luxon) for critical date/time functionality:

**Affected Files** (9 total):
- `src/lib/schedule.ts` - Core scheduling logic with DateTime, Interval, and timezone handling
- `src/lib/schedule-helpers.ts` - Schedule helper functions
- `src/lib/schedule-templates.ts` - Template definitions
- `src/lib/day-overrides.ts` - Day-specific schedule overrides
- `src/app/week/page.tsx` - Week view component
- `src/app/week/[date]/page.tsx` - Dynamic week view
- `src/app/day/page.tsx` - Day view component  
- `src/app/day/[date]/page.tsx` - Dynamic day view
- `src/components/PeriodBlock.tsx` - Period display component

**Key Operations Using Luxon**:
- ✓ DateTime parsing and formatting
- ✓ Interval creation and manipulation  
- ✓ Timezone configuration (America/Los_Angeles)
- ✓ Date arithmetic (adding/subtracting days)
- ✓ Week calculations and period scheduling

**Impact Assessment**: If a vulnerability existed in luxon, it would have **HIGH impact** on this project due to extensive usage in core functionality.

## Resolution Actions

### 1. Updated luxon Library

**Before**: `luxon@3.4.4` (package.json: `"^3.4.4"`)  
**After**: `luxon@3.7.2` (package.json: `"^3.7.2"`)  
**Change**: Minor version update (3 versions forward)

### 2. Updated TypeScript Definitions

**Before**: `@types/luxon@3.4.2` (package.json: `"^3.4.2"`)  
**After**: `@types/luxon@3.7.1` (package.json: `"^3.7.1"`)  
**Change**: Updated to match luxon version

### 3. Verification Steps Completed

| Test | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| TypeScript Compilation | ✅ PASS | No type errors with updated luxon |
| ESLint | ✅ PASS | No linting errors or warnings |
| Dependency Audit | ✅ PASS | No known vulnerabilities in luxon 3.7.2 |
| Package Installation | ✅ PASS | All dependencies installed successfully |

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Completed ✅)

1. ✅ Updated luxon to latest stable version (3.7.2)
2. ✅ Updated @types/luxon to matching version (3.7.1)
3. ✅ Verified compatibility with existing code
4. ✅ Confirmed no regressions in TypeScript/ESLint

### Follow-up Actions

1. **Monitor for CVE Clarification**: If CVE-2025-64756 is eventually published, review its specifics and confirm the update addresses it.

2. **Address Other Vulnerabilities**: Consider addressing the 11 vulnerabilities found in npm audit:
   ```bash
   npm audit fix                  # For non-breaking fixes
   npm audit fix --force          # For breaking changes (use cautiously)
   ```

3. **Implement Dependency Scanning**: Set up automated security scanning:
   - GitHub Dependabot alerts
   - Snyk integration
   - npm audit in CI/CD pipeline

4. **Regular Updates**: Establish a quarterly dependency update schedule to stay current with security patches.

5. **Testing**: While TypeScript and linting pass, consider running integration tests to verify date/time functionality works as expected.
